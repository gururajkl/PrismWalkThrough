* Regions refer to named areas within the user interface where views can be dynamically 
loaded and displayed. Regions provide a way to organize and manage the layout of views 
within a Prism application.

* Prism provides navigation support for regions, allowing you to navigate between 
views within a region or across different regions. This enables easy navigation and 
UI flow within the application.

* Provides the access to the regions.
* Used for view composition.
* Used for Region navigation.
* Used to define regions.
