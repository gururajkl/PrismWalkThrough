The "shell" refers to the main application window or container that hosts and manages the 
user interface of your application. 
It serves as the top-level container for the views and controls within application.

The shell provides the overall structure and layout for your application's user interface.
It typically includes menu bars, toolbars, navigation elements, status bars, and any other 
components that are persistent across different views or modules.

Prism follows the concept of a "Composite Application" where the application's functionality 
is divided into loosely coupled modules. The shell acts as a host for these modules, 
providing the regions where the modules' views can be dynamically loaded and displayed.

To create a new shell
* After creating a new window in the View
* Use Container.Resolve<type>();
* Container is the property of the PrismApplication base class (DryIoc) where it resolves the instance
of that type using the container.
