View discovery in Prism refers to the mechanism by which views are automatically 
discovered and registered within the Prism application. 
It allows you to define views in a modular and flexible way, reducing the 
need for explicit view registration and enabling dynamic view composition.

STEP 1: Create a view
STEP 2: Inside the module class create "private readonly IRegionManager regionManager;" and
	    inject to the ctor so DI container will resolve it.
STEP 3: Use this inside the OnInitailized method() 
		regionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion("regionName", typeof(ViewName));
