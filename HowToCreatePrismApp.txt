After creating a new Project (WPF) in VS, go to App.xaml
Step 1 -> Remove StartUpURI
Step 2 -> Add namespace xmlns:prism="http://prism:library.com"
Step 3 -> Then change the App to prism:PrismApplication

Then go to App.xaml.cs
Change the base class of the App class to PrismApplication, then override some abstract methods

That's it.. The prism application setup is complete now.

# Prism template pack reduces all these steps as it'll creates empty prism application for us.
