* Module in prism is just an functional resposibility of our Application.

* It's a self-contained unit that encapsulates a specific functionality or feature
 of an application. 

* Modules provide a way to organize and separate different parts of an application, 
promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

* Any class / project / user control that implements the IModule interface it can be referred as 
a module.

* This interface needs to implement two methods.

1. RegisterTypes(IContainerRegistery) -> 1st method invoked by prism.
2. OnInitialized(IContainerProvider) -> 2nd method invoked by prism.

WHAT IS MODULE CATALOG?
* Module catalog is a container / list type that stores the information about the modules in an 
application.

*  It serves as a registry or repository of module metadata, allowing the application to discover, 
load, and initialize the modules at runtime.

WAYS TO REGISTER THE MODULES
1. Code
2. App.COnfig
3. Disk / Directory
4. XAML
5. Custom

After this register the Catalog with prism app.
Then register the modules with catalog.

1st way, CODE :
Step 1: Add project reference to the main project.
Step 2: Then in App.xaml.cs override the ConfigureModuleCatalog
Step 3: AddTheModule<Type>()
add the breakpoint in the Module class of the reference project and see.
