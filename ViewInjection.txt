InIn Prism, the process of injecting views into regions involves programmatically
adding views to predefined regions within the user interface.
Instead of relying solely on view discovery mechanisms, we explicitly control 
the placement and composition of views within specific regions.

		IRegion region = regionManager.Regions["ContentRegion"];
        var view1 = containerProvider.Resolve<ViewA>();
		region.Add(view1);
